  Find a way to break the loop more elegantly.

  initially: scan for keyboard input and do something
             based on that input.

             e.g. a space bar tap

  default would be to wait a short while for spacebar
  input; if not present continue without further action
  (no input required to have loop continue after the
  pause).


    : waitfor 55555 0 do key? drop loop ; \ establish timing


33 33 --> see waitfor

hey very nice 'see' word just type it and the name no quotes

: waitfor 
    17 555 0 DO 
        key? \ seems to map to a keystroke
        32 - 0= IF
        EXIT
        THEN
        cr cr .s cr cr blink blink blink 
    LOOP 
; 

: waitfor 
    17 555 0 DO 
        key? cr cr .s cr cr blink blink blink 
    LOOP 
;
