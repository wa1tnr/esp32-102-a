     # please use statements in the form of:

     PATH="$HOME/.here/packages/tool-esptoolpy:$PATH"
     PATH="$HOME/.here/penv/bin:$PATH"

#   .here is typically .platformio

# The object is to use platformio in the current environment,
# and also use esptoolpy at the command line (in the Makefile).

# there are others ways to reach the same goal.  This is one way.
