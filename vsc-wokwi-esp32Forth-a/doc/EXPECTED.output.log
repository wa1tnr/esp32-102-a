  this anomaly (below) is now 'expected' and doesn't do
  a specific known (locally!) 'harm':

load:0x40080400,len:3028
entry 0x400805e4
E (1578) esp_core_dump_flash: No core dump partition found!
E (1578) esp_core_dump_flash: No core dump partition found!
[  1583][D][esp32-hal-cpu.c:244] setCpuFrequencyMhz(): PLL: 480 / 2 = 240 Mhz, APB: 80000000 Hz

that is to say, it is tolerated as a 'huh what is that' thought with
reasonable success.

Should be addressed in some way, of course.
